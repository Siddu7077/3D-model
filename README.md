## Features :
- Interactive 3D Human Model: View the human model in 360 degrees, zoom in/out, and rotate to see all angles.
- Adjustable Body Dimensions: Customize the height and width of the body to match your requirements.
- Upload and Fit Clothing: Upload a 3D model of clothing (e.g., men_suit_short_pant.glb) and adjust its size and position.
- Move and Rotate Clothing: Fine-tune the clothing fit by moving it up/down, left/right, front/back, and rotating on the x, y, and z axes.
- Color Combination Preview: Visualize how different clothing colors look on the model to help with your shopping decisions.
